      "The business of Paradise REIT is substantially dependent on the acquisition of the Pending Properties in the short term, and upon growing the portfolio of properties over the long term. Although Paradise REIT has entered into an agreement to acquire the Pending Properties as described elsewhere in this Offering Memorandum, Paradise REIT has not waived the conditions to closing in respect of the Pending Properties, which remain subject to due diligence and upon completion of the Offering. There can be no assurance that Paradise REIT will acquire the Pending Properties. The acquisition of additional properties in the future will be dependent on Paradise REIT raising new capital and mortgage financing for that purpose, both of which involve significant uncertainty. There is no assurance that Paradise REIT will be able to raise additional capital in the future, or the terms upon which such capital can be raised. In addition, there is no assurance that Paradise REIT will be able to obtain sufficient mortgage loans to finance future acquisitions, or if available, that Paradise REIT will be able to obtain mortgage loans on commercially reasonable terms. There can be no assurance that Paradise REIT will acquire additional properties in the future.",
